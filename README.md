# Overview
In this project, we analyze “New York Times Comments”, a data set having information about the comments made on the articles published in New York Times. NYT has extensive audience and plays important role in shaping people’s opinion about current affairs, especially in United States of America. The comments sections for articles in the NYT are quite active and give insights to readers’ opinions on the subject matter of the articles. Each comment can receive other readers’ recommendations in the form of upvotes. With that, we investigate the followings and share the insights on the NYT dataset:
* Analyze the most used Document Type and Type of Material
* Determine most Popular Author for the Articles
* Examine the sentiments of people based on positive and negative comments
* Inspect the recommendation's, reply, document type counts
